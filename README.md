# About Zefyr

*Soft and gentle rich text editing for Flutter applications.*

I made some changes for my project. If you want to use it then please feel free to use it.

This project has two extra features on top of zefyr version 0.11.0

1. attrDelegate - To make links clickable 
          ```ZefyrView(
                        xx:xx,
                        attrDelegate: CustomAttrDelegate(),
                      ),```
2. I have added a link preview feature (it doesn't work on Flutter Web because of CORS issue, otherwise it is perfect)
